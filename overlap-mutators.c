 *  Description:
 *      Mutator for feature1_len member in a bl_overlap_t structure.
 *      Use this function to set feature1_len in a bl_overlap_t variable
 *      from non-member functions.  This function performs a direct
 *      assignment for scalar or pointer structure members.  If
 *      feature1_len is a pointer, data previously pointed to should
 *      generally be freed before calling this function to avoid memory
 *      leaks.
 *
 *      Note that there is an equivalent macro (), which performs
 *      this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
 *      Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
 *      of new_feature1_len is guaranteed by other means.
 *      
 *
 *  Arguments:
 *      bl_overlap_ptr  Pointer to the bl_bed_t structure to set
 *      new_feature1_len The new value for feature1_len
 *
 *  Returns:
 *      BL_DATA_OK if the new value is acceptable and assigned
 *      BL_DATA_OUT_OF_RANGE otherwise
 *
 *  Examples:
 *      bl_overlap_t    bl_overlap;
