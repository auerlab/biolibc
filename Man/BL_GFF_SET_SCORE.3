BL_GFF_SET_SCORE(ptr, new_score)
.ad

ptr             Pointer to a bl_gff_t structure
new_score       New value for score

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for score.  Use this macro to set score in
a bl_gff_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_gff_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_gff_set_score(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_score is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_gff_t        bl_gff;
double          new_score;

BL_GFF_SET_SCORE(&bl_gff, new_score);
.ad
.fi
