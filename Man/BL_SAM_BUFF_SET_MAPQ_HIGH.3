.SH SYNOPSIS

.nf 
.na
BL_SAM_BUFF_SET_MAPQ_HIGH(ptr, new_mapq_high)
.ad
.fi

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf

ptr             Pointer to a bl_sam_buff_t structure
new_mapq_high   New value for mapq_high
.ad

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for mapq_high.  Use this macro to set mapq_high in
a bl_sam_buff_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_sam_buff_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_sam_buff_set_mapq_high(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_mapq_high is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_sam_buff_t   bl_sam_buff;
uint64_t        new_mapq_high;

BL_SAM_BUFF_SET_MAPQ_HIGH(&bl_sam_buff, new_mapq_high);
