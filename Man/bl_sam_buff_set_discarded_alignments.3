.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for discarded_alignments member in a bl_sam_buff_t structure.
Use this function to set discarded_alignments in a bl_sam_buff_t object
from non-member functions.  This function performs a direct
assignment for scalar or pointer structure members.  If
discarded_alignments is a pointer, data previously pointed to should
be freed before calling this function to avoid memory
leaks.

.SH RETURN VALUES

BL_SAM_BUFF_DATA_OK if the new value is acceptable and assigned
BL_SAM_BUFF_DATA_OUT_OF_RANGE otherwise
