.SH SYNOPSIS

BL_GFF_SET_SEQUENCE_AE(ptr, c, new_sequence_element)

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
ptr                     Pointer to a bl_gff_t structure
c                       Subscript to sequence array
new_sequence_element    New value for sequence[c]

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for sequence array elements.  Use this macro to set
an element of sequence in a bl_gff_t structure from functions
that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_gff_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_gff_set_sequence_ae(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_sequence_element is not validated by other means.

size_t          c;
char            new_sequence_element;

BL_GFF_SET_SEQUENCE_AE(&bl_gff, c, new_sequence_element);
