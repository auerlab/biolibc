.SH DESCRIPTION

Accessor macro for single_sample.  Use this macro to reference single_sample in
a bl_vcf_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_vcf_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_vcf_t        bl_vcf;
char *          single_sample;

single_sample = BL_VCF_SINGLE_SAMPLE(&bl_vcf);
.ad
.fi
