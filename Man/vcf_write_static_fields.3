.SH DESCRIPTION

Write static fields from one line of a single-entry VCF file.
Does not write sample data.

in the bit mask are written as an appropriate placeholder such as '.'
rather than the actual data.  Possible mask values are:

BL_VCF_FIELD_ALL
BL_VCF_FIELD_CHROM
BL_VCF_FIELD_POS
BL_VCF_FIELD_ID
BL_VCF_FIELD_REF
BL_VCF_FIELD_ALT
BL_VCF_FIELD_QUAL
BL_VCF_FIELD_FILTER
BL_VCF_FIELD_INFO
BL_VCF_FIELD_FORMAT
