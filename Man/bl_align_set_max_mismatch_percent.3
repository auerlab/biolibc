.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
int     bl_align_set_max_mismatch_percent(bl_align_t *bl_align_ptr, unsigned new_max_mismatch_percent)

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
bl_align_ptr    Pointer to the structure to set
new_max_mismatch_percent The new value for max_mismatch_percent
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for max_mismatch_percent member in a bl_align_t structure.
Use this function to set max_mismatch_percent in a bl_align_t variable
from non-member functions.  This function performs a direct
assignment for scalar or pointer structure members.  If
max_mismatch_percent is a pointer, data previously pointed to should
generally be freed before calling this function to avoid memory
leaks.

Note that there is an equivalent macro (), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_max_mismatch_percent is guaranteed by other means.

.SH RETURN VALUES

BL_DATA_OK if the new value is acceptable and assigned
BL_DATA_OUT_OF_RANGE otherwise

bl_align_t      bl_align;
unsigned        new_max_mismatch_percent;

if ( bl_align_set_max_mismatch_percent(&bl_align, new_max_mismatch_percent) == BL_DATA_OK )
