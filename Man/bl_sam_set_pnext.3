bl_sam_ptr      Pointer to the structure to set
new_pnext       The new value for pnext

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for pnext member in a bl_sam_t structure.
Use this function to set pnext in a bl_sam_t variable
from non-member functions.  This function performs a direct
assignment for scalar or pointer structure members.  If
pnext is a pointer, data previously pointed to should
generally be freed before calling this function to avoid memory
leaks.

Note that there is an equivalent macro (), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_pnext is guaranteed by other means.

.SH RETURN VALUES

BL_SAM_DATA_OK if the new value is acceptable and assigned
BL_SAM_DATA_OUT_OF_RANGE otherwise

.na

bl_sam_t        bl_sam;
uint64_t        new_pnext;
