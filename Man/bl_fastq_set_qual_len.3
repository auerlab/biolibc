.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for qual_len member in a bl_fastq_t structure.
Use this function to set qual_len in a bl_fastq_t variable
from non-member functions.  This function performs a direct
assignment for scalar or pointer structure members.  If
qual_len is a pointer, data previously pointed to should
generally be freed before calling this function to avoid memory
leaks.

Note that there is an equivalent macro (), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_qual_len is guaranteed by other means.

.na

bl_fastq_t      bl_fastq;
size_t          new_qual_len;

if ( bl_fastq_set_qual_len(&bl_fastq, new_qual_len) == BL_DATA_OK )
