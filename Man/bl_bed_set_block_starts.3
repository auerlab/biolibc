.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
int     bl_bed_set_block_starts(bl_bed_t *bl_bed_ptr, uint64_t * new_block_starts)

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf

bl_bed_ptr      Pointer to the structure to set
new_block_starts The new value for block_starts
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for block_starts member in a bl_bed_t structure.
Use this function to set block_starts in a bl_bed_t variable
from non-member functions.  This function performs a direct
assignment for scalar or pointer structure members.  If
block_starts is a pointer, data previously pointed to should
generally be freed before calling this function to avoid memory
leaks.

Note that there is an equivalent macro (), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_block_starts is guaranteed by other means.

.SH RETURN VALUES

BL_BED_DATA_OK if the new value is acceptable and assigned
BL_BED_DATA_OUT_OF_RANGE otherwise

.na

bl_bed_t        bl_bed;
