.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for feature2_len member in a bl_overlap_t structure.
Use this function to set feature2_len in a bl_overlap_t variable
from non-member functions.  This function performs a direct
assignment for scalar or pointer structure members.  If
feature2_len is a pointer, data previously pointed to should
generally be freed before calling this function to avoid memory
leaks.

Note that there is an equivalent macro (), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_feature2_len is guaranteed by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.na

bl_overlap_t    bl_overlap;
uint64_t        new_feature2_len;

if ( bl_overlap_set_feature2_len(&bl_overlap, new_feature2_len) == BL_DATA_OK )
{
