.SH DESCRIPTION

Accessor macro for start.  Use this macro to reference start in
a bl_gff_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_gff_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_gff_t        bl_gff;
int64_t         start;

start = BL_GFF_START(&bl_gff);
.ad
.fi

See biolibc/gff.h for a full list of macros.
