int     bl_overlap_set_overlap_start(
            bl_overlap_t *bl_overlap_ptr,

bl_overlap_ptr  Pointer to the structure to set
new_overlap_start The new value for overlap_start
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for overlap_start member in a bl_overlap_t structure.
Use this function to set overlap_start in a bl_overlap_t object
from non-member functions.  This function performs a direct
assignment for scalar or pointer structure members.  If
overlap_start is a pointer, data previously pointed to should
be freed before calling this function to avoid memory
leaks.

.SH RETURN VALUES

BL_OVERLAP_DATA_OK if the new value is acceptable and assigned
BL_OVERLAP_DATA_OUT_OF_RANGE otherwise

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.na

bl_overlap_t    bl_overlap;
uint64_t        new_overlap_start;

if ( bl_overlap_set_overlap_start(&bl_overlap, new_overlap_start)
        == BL_OVERLAP_DATA_OK )
{
