.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for seq member in a bl_sam_t structure.
Use this function to set seq in a bl_sam_t variable
from non-member functions.  This function performs a direct
assignment for scalar or pointer structure members.  If
seq is a pointer, data previously pointed to should
generally be freed before calling this function to avoid memory
leaks.

Note that there is an equivalent macro (), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_seq is guaranteed by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.na

bl_sam_t        bl_sam;
char *          new_seq;

if ( bl_sam_set_seq(&bl_sam, new_seq) == BL_DATA_OK )
{
}
