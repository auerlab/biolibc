.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for } member in a bl_fastx_t structure.
Use this function to set } in a bl_fastx_t variable
from non-member functions.  This function performs a direct
assignment for scalar or pointer structure members.  If
} is a pointer, data previously pointed to should
generally be freed before calling this function to avoid memory
leaks.

Note that there is an equivalent macro (), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_} is guaranteed by other means.

.SH RETURN VALUES

BL_FASTX_DATA_OK if the new value is acceptable and assigned
BL_FASTX_DATA_OUT_OF_RANGE otherwise
