int     bl_sam_set_mapq(bl_sam_t *bl_sam_ptr, unsigned char new_mapq)

bl_sam_ptr      Pointer to the structure to set
new_mapq        The new value for mapq

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for mapq member in a bl_sam_t structure.
Use this function to set mapq in a bl_sam_t variable
from non-member functions.  This function performs a direct
assignment for scalar or pointer structure members.  If
mapq is a pointer, data previously pointed to should
generally be freed before calling this function to avoid memory
leaks.

Note that there is an equivalent macro (), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_mapq is guaranteed by other means.

.SH RETURN VALUES

BL_SAM_DATA_OK if the new value is acceptable and assigned
BL_SAM_DATA_OUT_OF_RANGE otherwise

.na

bl_sam_t        bl_sam;
