.SH SYNOPSIS

.na
BL_OVERLAP_SET_FEATURE2_LEN(ptr, new_feature2_len)
.ad

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf

ptr             Pointer to a bl_overlap_t structure
new_feature2_len New value for feature2_len

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for feature2_len.  Use this macro to set feature2_len in
a bl_overlap_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_overlap_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_overlap_set_feature2_len(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_feature2_len is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_overlap_t    bl_overlap;
uint64_t        new_feature2_len;

BL_OVERLAP_SET_FEATURE2_LEN(&bl_overlap, new_feature2_len);
