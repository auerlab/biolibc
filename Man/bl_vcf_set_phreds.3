.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
int     bl_vcf_set_phreds(bl_vcf_t *bl_vcf_ptr, unsigned char * new_phreds)

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
bl_vcf_ptr      Pointer to the structure to set
new_phreds      The new value for phreds
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for phreds member in a bl_vcf_t structure.
Use this function to set phreds in a bl_vcf_t variable
from non-member functions.  This function performs a direct
assignment for scalar or pointer structure members.  If
phreds is a pointer, data previously pointed to should
generally be freed before calling this function to avoid memory
leaks.

Note that there is an equivalent macro (), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_phreds is guaranteed by other means.

.SH RETURN VALUES

BL_VCF_DATA_OK if the new value is acceptable and assigned
BL_VCF_DATA_OUT_OF_RANGE otherwise

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.na

bl_vcf_t        bl_vcf;
unsigned char * new_phreds;

if ( bl_vcf_set_phreds(&bl_vcf, new_phreds) == BL_VCF_DATA_OK )
{
