.SH DESCRIPTION

Open a raw SAM file using fopen() or a gzipped, bzipped, or
xzipped SAM file or BAM or CRAM file using popen().  If the
file extension is .bam or .cram, or samtools_args is not
NULL or "", data will be piped through "samtools view" with
the given samtools_args as arguments.  The flag --with-header
is always added for consistency with the case of reading a
raw SAM file without piping through samtools.  Programs that
don't want the header can filter it out by other means, such
as bl_sam_skip_header(3).

bl_sam_fopen() must be used in conjunction with
bl_sam_fclose() to ensure that fclose() or pclose() is called where
appropriate.

.SH RETURN VALUES

A pointer to the FILE structure or NULL if open failed
