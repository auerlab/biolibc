.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.nf 
.na
BL_SAM_SET_RNEXT_CPY(ptr, new_rnext)
.ad
.fi

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
ptr             Pointer to a bl_sam_t structure
new_rnext       New value for rnext
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for rnext.  Use this macro to set rnext in
a bl_sam_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_sam_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_sam_set_rnext_cpy(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_rnext is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_sam_t        bl_sam;
char            new_rnext[];

BL_SAM_SET_RNEXT_CPY(&bl_sam, new_rnext);
.ad
.fi
