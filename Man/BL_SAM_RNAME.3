.SH DESCRIPTION

Accessor macro for rname.  Use this macro to reference rname in
a bl_sam_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_sam_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_sam_t        bl_sam;
char            rname;

rname = BL_SAM_RNAME(&bl_sam);
.ad
.fi
