BL_SAM_BUFF_SET_UNMAPPED_ALIGNMENTS(ptr,unmapped_alignments)
.ad
.fi

.SH ARGUMENTS

ptr              Pointer to a bl_sam_buff_t structure
unmapped_alignments New value for ptr->unmapped_alignments
.ad

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for unmapped_alignments.  Use this macro to set the unmapped_alignments of
a bl_sam_buff_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_sam_buff_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_sam_buff_t   bl_sam_buff;

BL_SAM_BUFF_SET_UNMAPPED_ALIGNMENTS(&bl_sam_buff, new_unmapped_alignments);
.ad
.fi
