fasta_stream    FILE stream from which FASTA data are read
record          Pointer to a bl_fasta_t structure to receive data

.SH DESCRIPTION

Read a FASTA record from a FILE stream.  Each record must begin
with a description line (beginning with '>'), which is then
followed by one or more lines of sequence data.  The end of the
sequence is marked either by the next description line or EOF.
Memory is allocated for the description line and the sequence.
This memory should be freed as soon as possible by calling
bl_fasta_free(3).

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.na

bl_fasta_t  rec = BL_FASTA_INIT;

while ( bl_fasta_read(stdin, &rec) != BL_READ_EOF )
{
    bl_fasta_write(stdout, &rec, BL_FASTA_LINE_UNLIMITED);
    bl_fasta_free(&rec);
}
