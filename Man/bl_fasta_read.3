fasta_stream    FILE stream from which FASTA data are read
record          Pointer to a bl_fasta_t structure to receive data

.SH DESCRIPTION

Read a FASTA record from a FILE stream.  Each record must begin
with a description line (beginning with '>'), which is then
followed by one or more lines of sequence data.  The end of the
sequence is marked either by the next description line or EOF.
If desc_len and seq_len are 0 (e.g. the structure is initialized
with BL_FASTA_INIT or bl_fasta_init(3), or has been freed with
bl_fasta_free(3), then
memory is allocated for the description and sequence.

Otherwise, the existing allocated buffers are reused.  Hence, when
reading many FASTA records of the same length, only one allocation
is needed.  In any case, the buffers are automatically enlarged if
they become full and automatically trimmed to the actual data size
after reading is complete.

Buffer memory should be freed as soon as possible by calling
bl_fasta_free(3).

.SH EXAMPLES

bl_fasta_t  rec = BL_FASTA_INIT;

while ( bl_fasta_read(stdin, &rec) != BL_READ_EOF )
    bl_fasta_write(stdout, &rec, BL_FASTA_LINE_UNLIMITED);
bl_fasta_free(&rec);
