.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
long    next_stop_codon(FILE *rna_stream, char codon[4])

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
rna_stream  FILE stream containing RNA sequence data
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Locate the next stop codon in stream and report its position in
the input.  Reported positions are 0-based offsets from the file
position at the time of the call.  Hence, to find the absolute
positions of codons within a file stream across multiple calls to
next_start_codon() or next_stop_codon(), their return values should
added to the previous return value + 3 (the size of the previous
codon).  For example, givent the following input:

acaucauguucguggugacc

A call to next_start_codon() will return 5 (off set of AUG from the
beginning of the sequence and a subsequent call to next_stop_codon()
will return 7 (offset of UGA from the first base after the AUG).

.SH RETURN VALUES

1-based position of the next stop codon within the stream
or EOF if no codon is found.

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.na

unsigned long   pos;
char            codon[4];

if ( (pos = next_start_codon(stdin)) != EOF )
{
    printf("Start codon at %lu.n", pos);
    if ( (pos = next_stop_codon(stdin, codon)) != EOF )
        printf("Stop codon %s at %lu.n", codon, pos);
    else
        puts("No stop codon found.");
}
else
    puts("No start codon found.");
