.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
int     bl_gff_index_add(bl_gff_index_t *gi, bl_gff_t *feature)

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
gi      Pointer to gff_index_t object to which a record will be added
feature Pointer to GFF feature to be indexed
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

The gff_index_t class maintains an in-memory index of GFF
features, containing the GFF fields SEQ_ID, START, and END,
and the offset into the file as reported by ftell(3), or by
bl_gff_read(3), which records the file position of each GFF
feature it reads.

.B bl_gff_index_add_pos(3)
adds a GFF feature with file position file_pos to the index.
Features of interest, perhaps only genes or only exons, can
be added to the index on-the fly while reading through a GFF
file with bl_gff_read(3).

The index can later be searched or traversed forward or backward
to quickly find
the location of a feature and reposition a FILE pointer to it
using fseek(3).  This system eliminates the need to inhale
large numbers of GFF features into memory.

.SH RETURN VALUES

BL_GFF_INDEX_OK on success, BL_GFF_MALLOC_FAILED if memory could
not be allocated

bl_gff_index_t  gi;
bl_gff_t        feature;

if ( bl_gff_read(&feature, gff_stream, BL_GFF_FIELD_ALL) == BL_READ_OK )
{
    if ( bl_gff_index_add(&gi, &feature) != BL_GFF_INDEX_OK )
        fprintf(stderr, "Error addind to GFF index.n");
