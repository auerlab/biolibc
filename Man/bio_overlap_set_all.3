int     bl_overlap_set_all(bl_overlap_t *overlap,
uint64_t f1_len, uint64_t f2_len,
uint64_t ov_start, uint64_t ov_end)

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
f1_len:     Length of feature 1
f2_len:     Length of feature 2
ov_start:   Start position of overlap relative to start of feature 1
ov_end:     End position of overlap relative to start of feature 1
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Set all fields in a bl_overlap_t structure.  Start and end
positions are 1-based regardless of the feature type.  (BED file
positions are 0-based and must be adjusted before passed to this
function.)

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.na
bed_start = BL_BED_START_POS(bed_feature);
bed_end = BL_BED_END_POS(bed_feature);
gff_start = BL_GFF_START_POS(gff_feature);
gff_end = BL_GFF_END_POS(gff_feature);
bed_len = bed_end - bed_start;
gff_len = gff_end - gff_start + 1;
bl_overlap_set_all(overlap, bed_len, gff_len,
		    MAX(bed_start+1, gff_start),
		    MIN(bed_end, gff_end));
