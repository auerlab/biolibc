.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.nf 
.na
BL_BED_SET_BLOCK_STARTS(ptr,block_starts)
.ad
.fi

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
ptr              Pointer to a bl_bed_t structure
block_starts     New value for ptr->block_starts
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for block_starts.  Use this macro to set the block_starts of
a bl_bed_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_bed_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_bed_t   bl_bed;

BL_BED_SET_BLOCK_STARTS(&bl_bed, new_block_starts);
.ad
.fi
