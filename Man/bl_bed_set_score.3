.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for score member in a bl_bed_t structure.
Use this function to set score in a bl_bed_t variable
from non-member functions.  This function performs a direct
assignment for scalar or pointer structure members.  If
score is a pointer, data previously pointed to should
generally be freed before calling this function to avoid memory
leaks.

Note that there is an equivalent macro (), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_score is guaranteed by other means.

.na

bl_bed_t        bl_bed;
unsigned short  new_score;

if ( bl_bed_set_score(&bl_bed, new_score) == BL_DATA_OK )
{
}
