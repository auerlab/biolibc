.SH SYNOPSIS

BL_VCF_SET_SAMPLE_MAX(ptr, new_sample_max)
.ad

.SH ARGUMENTS

ptr             Pointer to a bl_vcf_t structure
new_sample_max  New value for sample_max
.ad

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for sample_max.  Use this macro to set sample_max in
a bl_vcf_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_vcf_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_vcf_set_sample_max(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_sample_max is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_vcf_t        bl_vcf;
size_t          new_sample_max;

BL_VCF_SET_SAMPLE_MAX(&bl_vcf, new_sample_max);
