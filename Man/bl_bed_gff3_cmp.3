.SH SYNOPSIS

int     bl_bed_gff3_cmp(bl_bed_t *bed_feature, bl_gff3_t *gff3_feature,
bl_overlap_t *overlap)
.ad

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
bed_feature     Pointer to the bl_bed_t structure to compare
gff3_feature     Pointer to the bl_gff3_t structure to compare
overlap         Pointer to the bl_overlap_t structure to receive
comparison results
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Compare the position of a BED feature to that of a GFF feature.
Return 0 if the features overlap, < 0 if the BED feature is upstream
of the GFF feature, > 0 if the BED feature is downstream of the GFF
feature.

If the features overlap, populate the bl_overlap_t structure
pointed to by overlap.  The structure contains the lengths of the
two features, the start and end positions of the overlapping region,
and the length of the overlap.  Positions in overlap are 1-based and
inclusive at both ends (like most bioinformatics formats and unlike
BED).

.SH RETURN VALUES

A value < 0 if the BED feature is upstream of the GFF feature
A value > 0 if the BED feature is downstream of the GFF feature
0 if the BED feature overlaps the GFF feature
