BL_SAM_SET_PNEXT(ptr, new_pnext)
.ad

.SH ARGUMENTS

ptr             Pointer to a bl_sam_t structure
new_pnext       New value for pnext
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for pnext.  Use this macro to set pnext in
a bl_sam_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_sam_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_sam_set_pnext(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_pnext is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_sam_t        bl_sam;
uint64_t        new_pnext;

BL_SAM_SET_PNEXT(&bl_sam, new_pnext);
.ad
