.SH SYNOPSIS

.nf 
.na
BL_BED_SET_FIELDS(ptr, new_fields)
.ad

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf

ptr             Pointer to a bl_bed_t structure
new_fields      New value for fields
.ad

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for fields.  Use this macro to set fields in
a bl_bed_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_bed_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_bed_set_fields(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_fields is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_bed_t        bl_bed;
unsigned short  new_fields;

BL_BED_SET_FIELDS(&bl_bed, new_fields);
.ad
.fi
