.SH SYNOPSIS

.na
BL_BED_SET_BLOCK_SIZES_AE(ptr, c, new_block_sizes_element)
.ad

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
ptr                     Pointer to a bl_bed_t structure
c                       Subscript to block_sizes array
new_block_sizes_element New value for block_sizes[c]
.ad

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for block_sizes array elements.  Use this macro to set
an element of block_sizes in a bl_bed_t structure from functions
that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_bed_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_bed_set_block_sizes_ae(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_block_sizes_element is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_bed_t        bl_bed;
size_t          c;
uint64_t *      new_block_sizes_element;

BL_BED_SET_BLOCK_SIZES_AE(&bl_bed, c, new_block_sizes_element);
