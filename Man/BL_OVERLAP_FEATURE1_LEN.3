.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION

Accessor macro for feature1_len.  Use this macro to reference the feature1_len of
a bl_overlap_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_overlap_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_overlap_t   bl_overlap;

feature1_len = BL_OVERLAP_FEATURE1_LEN(&bl_overlap);
.ad
.fi
