.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
int     bl_gff_read(bl_gff_t *gff_feature, FILE *gff_stream,
gff_field_mask_t field_mask)

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
gff_feature     Pointer to a bl_gff_t structure
gff_stream      A FILE stream from which to read the line
field_mask      Bit mask indicating which fields to store in gff_feature
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Read next feature (line) from a GFF file.

If field_mask is not BL_GFF_FIELD_ALL, fields not indicated by a 1
in the bit mask are discarded rather than stored in gff_feature.
That field in the structure is then populated with an appropriate
marker, such as '.'.  Possible mask values are:

BL_GFF_FIELD_ALL
BL_GFF_FIELD_SEQUENCE
BL_GFF_FIELD_SOURCE
BL_GFF_FIELD_FEATURE
BL_GFF_FIELD_START
BL_GFF_FIELD_END
BL_GFF_FIELD_SCORE
BL_GFF_FIELD_STRAND
BL_GFF_FIELD_PHASE
BL_GFF_FIELD_ATTRIBUTES

.SH RETURN VALUES

BL_READ_OK on successful read
BL_READ_EOF if EOF is encountered after a complete feature
BL_READ_TRUNCATED if EOF or bad data is encountered elsewhere

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.na

bl_gff_read(&gff_feature, stdin, BL_GFF_FIELD_ALL);
bl_gff_read(&gff_feature, gff_stream,
    BL_GFF_FIELD_SEQUENCE|BL_GFF_FIELD_START|BL_GFF_FIELD_END);
