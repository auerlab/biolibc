.SH SYNOPSIS

size_t  bl_fastq_find_5p_low_qual(const bl_fastq_t *read, unsigned min_qual,
unsigned phred_base)
.ad

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
read        FASTQ read to be searched
min_qual    Minimum quality of bases to keep
phred_base  Offset into the ISO character set used by PHRED scores
(usually 33 for modern data)

.SH DESCRIPTION

Locate end of a low-quality 5' end in a FASTQ read.  This
function uses the same algorithm as fastq and cutadapt as of the
time of writing.  Namely, it starts at the 5' end of the quality
string and sums (base quality - minimum quality) while moving in
the 3' direction.  This sum will be < 0 as long as the average
base quality is < minimum quality.  It also keeps track of where
the minimum of this sum occurs.  When the sum becomes > 0, we have
reached a point where the average quality of the 5' end is
satisfactory, and it is assumed it will remain that way if we
continue in the 3' direction.  ( Illumina reads tend to have low
quality near the 5' end. )  The location of the minimum sum is
then returned, since the average quality of everything in the 3'
direction must be satisfactory.

.SH RETURN VALUES

Index of first low-quality base at the 5' end if found,
index of NULL terminator otherwise
