BL_ALIGN_MAX_MISMATCH_PERCENT(ptr)

.SH DESCRIPTION

Accessor macro for max_mismatch_percent.  Use this macro to reference max_mismatch_percent in
a bl_align_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_align_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_align_t      bl_align;
unsigned        max_mismatch_percent;

max_mismatch_percent = BL_ALIGN_MAX_MISMATCH_PERCENT(&bl_align);
.ad
.fi
