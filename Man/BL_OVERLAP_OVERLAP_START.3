.SH DESCRIPTION

Accessor macro for overlap_start.  Use this macro to reference overlap_start in
a bl_overlap_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_overlap_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_overlap_t    bl_overlap;
uint64_t        overlap_start;

overlap_start = BL_OVERLAP_OVERLAP_START(&bl_overlap);
.ad
.fi
