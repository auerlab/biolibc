.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for discarded_score_sum member in a bl_sam_buff_t structure.
Use this function to set discarded_score_sum in a bl_sam_buff_t variable
from non-member functions.  This function performs a direct
assignment for scalar or pointer structure members.  If
discarded_score_sum is a pointer, data previously pointed to should
generally be freed before calling this function to avoid memory
leaks.

Note that there is an equivalent macro (), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_discarded_score_sum is guaranteed by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.na

bl_sam_buff_t   bl_sam_buff;
uint64_t        new_discarded_score_sum;

if ( bl_sam_buff_set_discarded_score_sum(&bl_sam_buff, new_discarded_score_sum) == BL_DATA_OK )
