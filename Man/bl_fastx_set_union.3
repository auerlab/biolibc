.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
int     bl_fastx_set_union(bl_fastx_t *bl_fastx_ptr, int new_union)

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf

bl_fastx_ptr    Pointer to the structure to set
new_union       The new value for union
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for union member in a bl_fastx_t structure.
Use this function to set union in a bl_fastx_t variable
from non-member functions.  This function performs a direct
assignment for scalar or pointer structure members.  If
union is a pointer, data previously pointed to should
generally be freed before calling this function to avoid memory
leaks.

Note that there is an equivalent macro (), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_union is guaranteed by other means.

.SH RETURN VALUES

BL_FASTX_DATA_OK if the new value is acceptable and assigned
BL_FASTX_DATA_OUT_OF_RANGE otherwise

.na

bl_fastx_t      bl_fastx;
int             new_union;
