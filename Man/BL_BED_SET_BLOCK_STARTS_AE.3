.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP

.na
BL_BED_SET_BLOCK_STARTS_AE(ptr, c, new_block_starts_element)
.ad

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
ptr                     Pointer to a bl_bed_t structure
c                       Subscript to block_starts array
new_block_starts_element New value for block_starts[c]
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for block_starts array elements.  Use this macro to set
an element of block_starts in a bl_bed_t structure from functions
that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_bed_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_bed_set_block_starts_ae(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_block_starts_element is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_bed_t        bl_bed;
size_t          c;
uint64_t *      new_block_starts_element;

BL_BED_SET_BLOCK_STARTS_AE(&bl_bed, c, new_block_starts_element);
