.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION

Accessor macro for pos.  Use this macro to reference pos in
a bl_sam_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_sam_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_sam_t        bl_sam;
uint64_t        pos;

pos = BL_SAM_POS(&bl_sam);
.ad
.fi
