.SH SYNOPSIS

.nf 
.na
BL_GFF_SET_END(ptr, new_end)
.ad
.fi

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf

ptr             Pointer to a bl_gff_t structure
new_end         New value for end
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for end.  Use this macro to set end in
a bl_gff_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_gff_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_gff_set_end(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_end is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_gff_t        bl_gff;
uint64_t        new_end;

BL_GFF_SET_END(&bl_gff, new_end);
.ad
.fi
