int     vcf_read_static_fields(FILE *vcf_stream, bl_vcf_t *vcf_call,
vcf_field_mask_t field_mask)
.ad

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf

vcf_stream: FILE stream for VCF input
vcf_call:   Pointer to bl_vcf_t structure to receive fields
field_mask: Bit mask indicating which fields should be stored

.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Read static fields (columns 1 to 9) from one line of a VCF file.
This function does not read any of the sample data in columns 10
and on.  Samples can be read using a loop with tsv_read_field(3).

If field_mask is not VCF_FIELD_ALL, fields not indicated by a 1
in the bit mask are discarded rather than stored in bed_feature.
Possible mask values are:

VCF_FIELD_ALL
VCF_FIELD_CHROM
VCF_FIELD_POS
VCF_FIELD_ID
VCF_FIELD_REF
VCF_FIELD_ALT
VCF_FIELD_QUAL
VCF_FIELD_FILTER
VCF_FIELD_INFO
VCF_FIELD_FORMAT
