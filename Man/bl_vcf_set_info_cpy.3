.SH SYNOPSIS

int     bl_vcf_set_info_cpy(bl_vcf_t *bl_vcf_ptr, char * new_info, size_t array_size)
.ad
.fi

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
bl_vcf_ptr      Pointer to the bl_bed_t structure to set
new_info        The new value for info
array_size      Size of the info array.

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for info member in a bl_vcf_t structure.
Use this function to set info in a bl_vcf_t variable
from non-member functions.  This function copies the array pointed to
by new_info to ->info.

Note that there is an equivalent macro BL_VCF_SET_INFO(), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_info is guaranteed by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.na

bl_vcf_t        bl_vcf;
char *          new_info;
size_t          array_size;

bl_vcf_set_info(&bl_vcf, new_info, array_size);
.ad
