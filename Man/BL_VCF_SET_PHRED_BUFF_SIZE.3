.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for phred_buff_size.  Use this macro to set phred_buff_size in
a bl_vcf_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_vcf_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_vcf_set_phred_buff_size(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_phred_buff_size is not validated by other means.

bl_vcf_t        bl_vcf;
size_t          new_phred_buff_size;
