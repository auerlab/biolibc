.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
int     bl_sam_buff_set_max_discarded_score(bl_sam_buff_t *bl_sam_buff_ptr, uint64_t new_max_discarded_score)

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
bl_sam_buff_ptr Pointer to the structure to set
new_max_discarded_score The new value for max_discarded_score
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for max_discarded_score member in a bl_sam_buff_t structure.
Use this function to set max_discarded_score in a bl_sam_buff_t variable
from non-member functions.  This function performs a direct
assignment for scalar or pointer structure members.  If
max_discarded_score is a pointer, data previously pointed to should
generally be freed before calling this function to avoid memory
leaks.

Note that there is an equivalent macro (), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_max_discarded_score is guaranteed by other means.

.SH RETURN VALUES

BL_SAM_BUFF_DATA_OK if the new value is acceptable and assigned
BL_SAM_BUFF_DATA_OUT_OF_RANGE otherwise

.SH EXAMPLES

.na

bl_sam_buff_t   bl_sam_buff;
uint64_t        new_max_discarded_score;

if ( bl_sam_buff_set_max_discarded_score(&bl_sam_buff, new_max_discarded_score) == BL_SAM_BUFF_DATA_OK )
