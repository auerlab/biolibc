.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
int     bl_bed_read(FILE *bed_stream, bl_bed_t *bed_feature,
bed_field_mask_t field_mask)

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
bed_stream      A FILE stream from which to read the line
bed_feature     Pointer to a bl_bed_t structure
field_mask      Bit mask indicating which fields to store in bed_feature
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Read next entry (line) from a BED file.  The line must have at
least the first 3 fields (chrom, start, and end).  It may
have up to 12 fields, all of which must be in the correct order
according to the BED specification.

If field_mask is not BL_BED_FIELD_ALL, fields not indicated by a 1
in the bit mask are discarded rather than stored in bed_feature.
Possible mask values are:

BL_BED_FIELD_ALL
BL_BED_FIELD_NAME
BL_BED_FIELD_SCORE
BL_BED_FIELD_STRAND
BL_BED_FIELD_THICK
BL_BED_FIELD_RGB
BL_BED_FIELD_BLOCK

The chrom, start, and end fields are required and therefore have
no corresponding mask bits. The thickStart and thickEnd fields must
occur together or not at all, so only a single bit BL_BED_FIELD_THICK
selects both of them.  Likewise, blockCount, blockSizes and
blockStarts must all be present or omitted, so BL_BED_FIELD_BLOCK
masks all three.

.SH RETURN VALUES

BL_READ_OK on successful read
BL_READ_EOF if EOF is encountered at the start of a line
BL_READ_TRUNCATED if EOF or bad data is encountered elsewhere

.SH EXAMPLES

.na

bl_bed_read(stdin, &bed_feature, BL_BED_FIELD_ALL);
bl_bed_read(bed_stream, &bed_feature,
                 BL_BED_FIELD_NAME|BL_BED_FIELD_SCORE);
