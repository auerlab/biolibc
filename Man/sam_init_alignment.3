.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
sam_alignment:  Pointer to bl_sam_t structure to initialize
seq_len:        Length of sequence and quality strings
field_mask:     Bit mask indicating which fields will be used
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Initialize a bl_sam_t structure, allocating memory for
sequence and quality strings according to seq_len.  Passing a
seq_len of 0 prevents memory allocation from occurring.

Only BL_SAM_FIELD_SEQ and BL_SAM_FIELD_QUAL are meaningful bits in
field_mask, as they determine whether memory is allocated.  All
other fields are unconditionally initialized to 0, NULL, or blank.
