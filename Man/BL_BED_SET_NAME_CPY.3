BL_BED_SET_NAME_CPY(ptr, new_name)

ptr             Pointer to a bl_bed_t structure
new_name        New value for name
.ad

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for name.  Use this macro to set name in
a bl_bed_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_bed_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_bed_set_name_cpy(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_name is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_bed_t        bl_bed;
char            new_name[];

BL_BED_SET_NAME_CPY(&bl_bed, new_name);
.ad
