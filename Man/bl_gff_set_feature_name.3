.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for feature_name member in a bl_gff_t structure.
Use this function to set feature_name in a bl_gff_t object
from non-member functions.  This function performs a direct
assignment for scalar or pointer structure members.  If
feature_name is a pointer, data previously pointed to should
be freed before calling this function to avoid memory
leaks.

.SH RETURN VALUES

BL_GFF_DATA_OK if the new value is acceptable and assigned
BL_GFF_DATA_OUT_OF_RANGE otherwise
