.SH SYNOPSIS

.na
BL_VCF_SET_INFO_LEN(ptr, new_info_len)
.ad
.fi

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf

ptr             Pointer to a bl_vcf_t structure
new_info_len    New value for info_len
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for info_len.  Use this macro to set info_len in
a bl_vcf_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_vcf_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_vcf_set_info_len(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_info_len is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_vcf_t        bl_vcf;
size_t          new_info_len;

BL_VCF_SET_INFO_LEN(&bl_vcf, new_info_len);
.ad
