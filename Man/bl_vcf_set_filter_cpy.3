.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
bl_vcf_ptr      Pointer to the bl_bed_t structure to set
new_filter      The new value for filter
array_size      Size of the filter array.

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for filter member in a bl_vcf_t structure.
Use this function to set filter in a bl_vcf_t variable
from non-member functions.  This function copies the array pointed to
by new_filter to ->filter.

Note that there is an equivalent macro BL_VCF_SET_FILTER(), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_filter is guaranteed by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.na

bl_vcf_t        bl_vcf;
char            new_filter;
size_t          array_size;

if ( bl_vcf_set_filter(&bl_vcf, new_filter, array_size) == BL_DATA_OK )
{
}
