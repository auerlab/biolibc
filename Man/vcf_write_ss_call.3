field_mask: Bit mask indicating which fields to output

.SH DESCRIPTION

Write a single-sample VCF call to vcf_stream.
This should only be used with VCF calls that have exactly one
sample column.  For multisample VCFs, use vcf_write_static_fields()
followed by a loop to write the sample data.

If field_mask is not VCF_FIELD_ALL, fields not indicated by a 1
in the bit mask are written as an appropriate placeholder such as '.'
rather than the actual data.  Possible mask values are:

VCF_FIELD_ALL
VCF_FIELD_CHROM
VCF_FIELD_POS
VCF_FIELD_ID
VCF_FIELD_REF
VCF_FIELD_ALT
VCF_FIELD_QUAL
VCF_FIELD_FILTER
VCF_FIELD_INFO
VCF_FIELD_FORMAT
