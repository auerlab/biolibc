.SH ARGUMENTS

vcf_stream: FILE pointer to the VCF output stream
vcf_call:   Pointer to the bl_vcf_t structure to output
field_mask: Bit mask indicating which fields to output
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Write a single-sample VCF call to vcf_stream.
This should only be used with VCF calls that have exactly one
sample column.  For multisample VCFs, use bl_vcf_write_static_fields()
followed by a loop to write the sample data.

If field_mask is not BL_VCF_FIELD_ALL, fields not indicated by a 1
in the bit mask are written as an appropriate placeholder such as '.'
rather than the actual data.  Possible mask values are:

BL_VCF_FIELD_ALL
BL_VCF_FIELD_CHROM
BL_VCF_FIELD_POS
BL_VCF_FIELD_ID
BL_VCF_FIELD_REF
BL_VCF_FIELD_ALT
BL_VCF_FIELD_QUAL
BL_VCF_FIELD_FILTER
BL_VCF_FIELD_INFO
BL_VCF_FIELD_FORMAT
