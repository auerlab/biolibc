.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.nf 
.na
int     bed_read_feature(FILE *bed_stream, bed_feature_t *bed_feature,
bed_field_mask_t field_mask)
.ad
.fi

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
bed_stream:     A FILE stream from which to read the line
bed_feature:    Pointer to a bed_feature_t structure
field_mask:     Bit mask indicating which fields to store in bed_feature
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Read next entry (line) from a BED file.  The line must have at
least the first 3 fields (chromosome, start, and end).  It may
have up to 12 fields, all of which must be in the correct order
according to the BED specification.

If field_mask is not BED_FIELD_ALL, fields not indicated by a 1
in the bit mask are discarded rather than stored in bed_feature.
Possible mask values are:

BED_FIELD_NAME
BED_FIELD_SCORE
BED_FIELD_STRAND
BED_FIELD_THICK
BED_FIELD_RGB
BED_FIELD_BLOCK

The chromosome, start, and end fields are required and therefore have
no corresponding mask bits. The thickStart and thickEnd fields must
occur together or not at all, so only a single bit BED_FIELD_THICK
selects both of them.  Likewise, blockCount, blockSizes and
blockStarts must all be present or omitted, so BED_FIELD_BLOCK
masks all three.

.SH EXAMPLES

.na

bed_read_feature(stdin, &bed_feature, BED_FIELD_ALL);
bed_read_feature(bed_stream, &bed_feature,
BED_FIELD_NAME|BED_FIELD_SCORE);
