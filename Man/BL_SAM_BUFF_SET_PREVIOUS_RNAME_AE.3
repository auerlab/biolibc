.SH SYNOPSIS

BL_SAM_BUFF_SET_PREVIOUS_RNAME_AE(ptr, c, new_previous_rname_element)
.ad

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
ptr                     Pointer to a bl_sam_buff_t structure
c                       Subscript to previous_rname array
new_previous_rname_element New value for previous_rname[c]
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for previous_rname array elements.  Use this macro to set
an element of previous_rname in a bl_sam_buff_t structure from functions
that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_sam_buff_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_sam_buff_set_previous_rname_ae(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_previous_rname_element is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.na
bl_sam_buff_t   bl_sam_buff;
size_t          c;
char            new_previous_rname_element;

BL_SAM_BUFF_SET_PREVIOUS_RNAME_AE(&bl_sam_buff, c, new_previous_rname_element);
