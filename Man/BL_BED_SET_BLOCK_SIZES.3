.SH SYNOPSIS

.na
BL_BED_SET_BLOCK_SIZES(ptr, new_block_sizes)
.ad

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf

ptr             Pointer to a bl_bed_t structure
new_block_sizes New value for block_sizes
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for block_sizes.  Use this macro to set block_sizes in
a bl_bed_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_bed_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_bed_set_block_sizes(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_block_sizes is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_bed_t        bl_bed;
uint64_t *      new_block_sizes;

BL_BED_SET_BLOCK_SIZES(&bl_bed, new_block_sizes);
.ad
