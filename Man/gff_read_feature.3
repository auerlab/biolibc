.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
gff_stream: FILE pointer to the open GFF file
gff_stream:     A FILE stream from which to read the line
gff_feature:    Pointer to a bl_gff_t structure
field_mask:     Bit mask indicating which fields to store in gff_feature

.SH DESCRIPTION

Skip over header lines in gff input stream.  The FILE pointer
gff_stream is advanced to the first character of the first line
after the header.  The header is copied to a temporary file and and
the function returns a FILE pointer to the header stream.


Read next feature (line) from a GFF file.

If field_mask is not GFF_FIELD_ALL, fields not indicated by a 1
in the bit mask are discarded rather than stored in gff_feature.
That field in the structure is then populated with an appropriate
marker, such as '.'.  Possible mask values are:

GFF_FIELD_ALL
GFF_FIELD_SEQUENCE
GFF_FIELD_SOURCE
GFF_FIELD_NAME
GFF_FIELD_START_POS
GFF_FIELD_END_POS
GFF_FIELD_SCORE
GFF_FIELD_STRAND
GFF_FIELD_PHASE
GFF_FIELD_ATTRIBUTES
