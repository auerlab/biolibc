name1, name2    Names of two chroms

.SH DESCRIPTION

Perform a numeric comparison of two chrom names.

The names may contain a prefix of non-digits, such as "chr".
Characters that follow must be a chrom number or letter.
Numbers are considered less than letters (e.g. 22 < X).  As such,
if either is a letter, they are compared lexically.  If both are
numbers, they are converted to integers and compared numerically.

Use bl_chrom_name_cmp() only if you need to know which string is
< or >.  If only checking for equality/inequality, strcmp() will be
faster.

.SH RETURN VALUES

A value < 1 if name1 is numerically < name2
A value > 1 if name1 is numerically > name2
0 if name1 == name2
