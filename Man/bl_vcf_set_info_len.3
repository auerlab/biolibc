.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for info_len member in a bl_vcf_t structure.
Use this function to set info_len in a bl_vcf_t variable
from non-member functions.  This function performs a direct
assignment for scalar or pointer structure members.  If
info_len is a pointer, data previously pointed to should
generally be freed before calling this function to avoid memory
leaks.

Note that there is an equivalent macro (), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_info_len is guaranteed by other means.

.na

bl_vcf_t        bl_vcf;
size_t          new_info_len;

bl_vcf_set_info_len(&bl_vcf, new_info_len);
