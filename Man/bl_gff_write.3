FILE *gff_stream)

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na

.SH DESCRIPTION

Write fields from a GFF feature to the specified FILE
stream.

If field_mask is not BL_GFF_FIELD_ALL, fields not indicated by a 1
in the bit mask are written as an appropriate marker for that field,
such as a '.', rather than writing the real data.
Possible mask values are:

BL_GFF_FIELD_ALL
BL_GFF_FIELD_SEQUENCE
BL_GFF_FIELD_SOURCE
BL_GFF_FIELD_FEATURE
BL_GFF_FIELD_START
BL_GFF_FIELD_END
BL_GFF_FIELD_SCORE
BL_GFF_FIELD_STRAND
BL_GFF_FIELD_PHASE
BL_GFF_FIELD_ATTRIBUTES

.SH RETURN VALUES

BL_WRITE_OK on success
BL_WRITE_ERROR on failure (errno may provide more information)
