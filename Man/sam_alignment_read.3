.SH SYNOPSIS

int     sam_alignment_read(FILE *sam_stream, sam_alignment_t *sam_alignment,
sam_field_mask_t field_mask)

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
sam_stream:     A FILE stream from which to read the line
sam_alignment:  Pointer to a sam_alignment_t structure
field_mask:     Bit mask indicating which fields to store in sam_alignment
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Read next alignment (line) from a SAM stream.

If field_mask is not SAM_FIELD_ALL, fields not indicated by a 1
in the bit mask are discarded rather than stored in sam_alignment.
That field in the structure is then populated with an appropriate
marker, such as '.'.  Possible mask values are:

SAM_FIELD_ALL
SAM_FIELD_QNAME
SAM_FIELD_FLAG
SAM_FIELD_RNAME
SAM_FIELD_POS
SAM_FIELD_MAPQ
SAM_FIELD_CIGAR
SAM_FIELD_RNEXT
SAM_FIELD_PNEXT
SAM_FIELD_TLEN
SAM_FIELD_SEQ
SAM_FIELD_QUAL

.na

sam_alignment_read(stdin, &sam_alignment, SAM_FIELD_ALL);
sam_alignment_read(sam_stream, &sam_alignment,
SAM_FIELD_QNAME|SAM_FIELD_POS|SAM_FIELD_TLEN);
