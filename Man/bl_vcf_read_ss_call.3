.SH SYNOPSIS

int     bl_vcf_read_ss_call(FILE *vcf_stream, bl_vcf_t *vcf_call,
vcf_field_mask_t field_mask)

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
vcf_stream  FILE pointer to VCF input stream
vcf_call    bl_vcf_t structure to receive VCF data
field_mask  Bit mask to indicate which fields to store
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Read a single-sample VCF call (static fields and one sample column).
This should only be used with VCF inputs that have exactly one
sample column.  For multisample VCFs, use bl_vcf_read_static_fields()
followed by a loop to read the sample data.

If field_mask is not BL_VCF_FIELD_ALL, fields not indicated by a 1
in the bit mask are discarded rather than stored in bed_feature.
Possible mask values are:

BL_VCF_FIELD_ALL
BL_VCF_FIELD_CHROM
BL_VCF_FIELD_POS
BL_VCF_FIELD_ID
BL_VCF_FIELD_REF
BL_VCF_FIELD_ALT
BL_VCF_FIELD_QUAL
BL_VCF_FIELD_FILTER
BL_VCF_FIELD_INFO
BL_VCF_FIELD_FORMAT

.SH RETURN VALUES

BL_READ_OK upon success
BL_READ_TRUNCATED if EOF is encountered while reading a call
BL_READ_EOF if EOF is encountered between calls as it should be
