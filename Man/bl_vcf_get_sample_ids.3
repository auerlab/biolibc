vcf_stream  FILE pointer to the VCF input stream

first_col   First column from which a sample ID should be saved
last_col    Last column from which a sample ID should be saved

.SH DESCRIPTION

Extract sample IDs from a VCF input header line.  This is typically
done following bl_vcf_skip_meta_data(3), which will leave the FILE
pointer pointing to the beginning of the header line, if one is
present.

The arguments first_col and last_col represent the first and
last sample columns, both inclusive, from which sample IDs should
be extracted.  A value of 1 represents the first sample column.
This feature allows a VCF file with many columns to be processed
in multiple stages.  For example, the vcf-split tool, based on
biolibc, cannot efficiently process more than abou1 10,000 samples
at once, since each sample requires an open output file.  A VCF
with 150,000 samples can be processed in 15 separate passes.
