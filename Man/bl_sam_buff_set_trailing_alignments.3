.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for trailing_alignments member in a bl_sam_buff_t structure.
Use this function to set trailing_alignments in a bl_sam_buff_t variable
from non-member functions.  This function performs a direct
assignment for scalar or pointer structure members.  If
trailing_alignments is a pointer, data previously pointed to should
generally be freed before calling this function to avoid memory
leaks.

Note that there is an equivalent macro (), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_trailing_alignments is guaranteed by other means.

bl_sam_buff_t   bl_sam_buff;

if ( bl_sam_buff_set_trailing_alignments(&bl_sam_buff, new_trailing_alignments) == BL_DATA_OK )
