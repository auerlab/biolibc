.SH DESCRIPTION

Compare the positions of a SAM alignment and a GFF feature and
return a status value much like strcmp().  0 is returned if the
alignment and feature overlap.  A value < 0 is returned if the
alignment is entirely "before" the feature, i.e. it is on an
earlier chromosome according to bl_chrom_name_cmp(3), or on the
same chromosome at a lower position.  A value > 0 is returned
if the alignment is entirely "after" the feature, i.e. on a later
chromosome or same chromosome and higher position.

This function is mainly intended for programs that sweep properly
sorted GFF and SAM files locating overlaps in a single pass.

A converse function, bl_gff3_sam_cmp(3) is also provided so that
the programmer can choose the more intuitive interface.

.SH RETURN VALUES

A value < 0 if the the alignment is entirely before the feature
A value > 0 if the the alignment is entirely after the feature
0 if the alignment and the feature overlap
