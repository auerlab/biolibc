.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.nf 
.na
BL_SAM_BUFF_SET_TRAILING_ALIGNMENTS(ptr,trailing_alignments)
.ad
.fi

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
ptr              Pointer to a bl_sam_buff_t structure
trailing_alignments New value for ptr->trailing_alignments
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for trailing_alignments.  Use this macro to set the trailing_alignments of
a bl_sam_buff_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_sam_buff_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_sam_buff_t   bl_sam_buff;

BL_SAM_BUFF_SET_TRAILING_ALIGNMENTS(&bl_sam_buff, new_trailing_alignments);
.ad
.fi
