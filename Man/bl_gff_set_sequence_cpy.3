.SH ARGUMENTS

bl_gff_ptr      Pointer to the structure to set
new_sequence    The new value for sequence
array_size      Size of the sequence array.

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for sequence member in a bl_gff_t structure.
Use this function to set sequence in a bl_gff_t variable
from non-member functions.  This function copies the array pointed to
by new_sequence to ->sequence.

Note that there is an equivalent macro BL_GFF_SET_SEQUENCE(), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_sequence is guaranteed by other means.

bl_gff_t        bl_gff;
char            new_sequence;
size_t          array_size;

if ( bl_gff_set_sequence(&bl_gff, new_sequence, array_size) == BL_DATA_OK )
{
}
