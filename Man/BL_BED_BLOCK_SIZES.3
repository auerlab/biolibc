.SH DESCRIPTION

Accessor macro for block_sizes.  Use this macro to reference block_sizes in
a bl_bed_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_bed_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_bed_t        bl_bed;
uint64_t *      block_sizes;

block_sizes = BL_BED_BLOCK_SIZES(&bl_bed);
.ad
.fi

See biolibc/bed.h for a full list of macros.
