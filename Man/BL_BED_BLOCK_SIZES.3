.SH SYNOPSIS

ptr     Pointer to a bl_bed_t structure
.ad

.SH DESCRIPTION

Accessor macro for block_sizes.  Use this macro to reference the block_sizes of
a bl_bed_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_bed_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_bed_t   bl_bed;

block_sizes = BL_BED_BLOCK_SIZES(&bl_bed);
.ad
.fi
