.SH SYNOPSIS

.nf

ptr     Pointer to a bl_vcf_t structure
.ad

.SH DESCRIPTION

Accessor macro for info_len.  Use this macro to reference the info_len of
a bl_vcf_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_vcf_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_vcf_t   bl_vcf;

info_len = BL_VCF_INFO_LEN(&bl_vcf);
.ad
.fi
