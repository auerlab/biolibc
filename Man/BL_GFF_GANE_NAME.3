.SH DESCRIPTION

Accessor macro for gane_name.  Use this macro to reference the gane_name of
a bl_gff_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_gff_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_gff_t   bl_gff;

gane_name = BL_GFF_GANE_NAME(&bl_gff);
.ad
.fi
