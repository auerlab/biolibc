.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf

sam_buff:       Pointer to a SAM buffer with recent alignments
sam_alignment:  Pointer to the most recently read alignment
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Check that the newly read SAM alignment comes after the previous
one, assuming the input is sorted first by chromosome and then
position.  The previous chromosome and position are stored in
sam_buff (and initialized so that the first SAM alignment read is
always OK).
