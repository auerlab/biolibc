.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
int     bl_gff_set_feature_ae(bl_gff_t *bl_gff_ptr, size_t c, char new_feature_element)

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
bl_gff_ptr      Pointer to the structure to set
c               Subscript to the feature array
new_feature_element The new value for feature[c]
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for an array element of feature member in a bl_gff_t
structure. Use this function to set an element of the array
feature in a bl_gff_t variable from non-member functions.

Note that there is an equivalent macro BL_GFF_SET_FEATURE_AE(), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_feature_element is guaranteed by other means.

.SH RETURN VALUES

BL_GFF_DATA_OK if the new value is acceptable and assigned
BL_GFF_DATA_OUT_OF_RANGE otherwise

.SH EXAMPLES

.na

bl_gff_t        bl_gff;
size_t          c;
char            new_feature_element;

if ( bl_gff_set_feature_ae(&bl_gff, c, new_feature_element) == BL_GFF_DATA_OK )
