.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
ptr                     Pointer to a bl_gff_t structure
c                       Subscript to gene_name array
new_gene_name_element   New value for gene_name[c]

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for gene_name array elements.  Use this macro to set
an element of gene_name in a bl_gff_t structure from functions
that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_gff_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_gff_set_gene_name_ae(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_gene_name_element is not validated by other means.

bl_gff_t        bl_gff;

char *          new_gene_name_element;

BL_GFF_SET_GENE_NAME_AE(&bl_gff, c, new_gene_name_element);
