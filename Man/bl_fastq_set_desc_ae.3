.SH SYNOPSIS

int     bl_fastq_set_desc_ae(bl_fastq_t *bl_fastq_ptr, size_t c, char  new_desc_element)
.ad

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
bl_fastq_ptr    Pointer to the bl_bed_t structure to set
c               Subscript to the desc array
new_desc_element The new value for desc[c]
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for an array element of desc member in a bl_fastq_t
structure. Use this function to set an element of the array
desc in a bl_fastq_t variable from non-member functions.

Note that there is an equivalent macro BL_FASTQ_SET_DESC_AE(), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_desc_element is guaranteed by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.na

bl_fastq_t      bl_fastq;
size_t          c;
char *          new_desc_element;

if ( bl_fastq_set_desc(&bl_fastq, c, new_desc_element) == BL_DATA_OK )
{
}
