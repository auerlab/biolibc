.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
bl_vcf_ptr      Pointer to the bl_bed_t structure to set
c               Subscript to the filter array
new_filter_element The new value for filter[c]
.ad

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for an array element of filter member in a bl_vcf_t
structure. Use this function to set an element of the array
filter in a bl_vcf_t variable from non-member functions.

Note that there is an equivalent macro BL_VCF_SET_FILTER_AE(), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_filter_element is guaranteed by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.na

bl_vcf_t        bl_vcf;
size_t          c;
char            new_filter_element;

if ( bl_vcf_set_filter(&bl_vcf, c, new_filter_element) == BL_DATA_OK )
{
}
