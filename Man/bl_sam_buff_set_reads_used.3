.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for reads_used member in a bl_sam_buff_t structure.
Use this function to set reads_used in a bl_sam_buff_t variable
from non-member functions.  This function performs a direct
assignment for scalar or pointer structure members.  If
reads_used is a pointer, data previously pointed to should
generally be freed before calling this function to avoid memory
leaks.

Note that there is an equivalent macro (), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_reads_used is guaranteed by other means.
