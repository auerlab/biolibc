.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for "block_sizes" member of a bl_bed_t structure.
Use this function to set block_sizes in a bl_bed_t variable
from non-member functions.  This function performs a direct
assignment for scalar or pointer structure members.  If
block_sizes is a pointer, data previously pointed to should
generally be freed before calling this function to avoid memory
leaks.

Note that there is an equivalent macro (), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_block_sizes is guaranteed by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.na

bl_bed_t        bl_bed;
uint64_t *      new_block_sizes;

bl_bed_set_block_sizes(&bl_bed, new_block_sizes);
