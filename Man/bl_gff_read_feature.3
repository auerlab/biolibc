.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
gff_stream:     A FILE stream from which to read the line
gff_feature:    Pointer to a bl_gff_t structure

.SH DESCRIPTION

Read next feature (line) from a GFF file.

If field_mask is not BL_GFF_FIELD_ALL, fields not indicated by a 1
in the bit mask are discarded rather than stored in gff_feature.
That field in the structure is then populated with an appropriate
marker, such as '.'.  Possible mask values are:

BL_GFF_FIELD_ALL
BL_GFF_FIELD_SEQUENCE
BL_GFF_FIELD_SOURCE
BL_GFF_FIELD_NAME
BL_GFF_FIELD_START_POS
BL_GFF_FIELD_END_POS
BL_GFF_FIELD_SCORE
BL_GFF_FIELD_STRAND
BL_GFF_FIELD_PHASE
BL_GFF_FIELD_ATTRIBUTES
