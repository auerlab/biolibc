.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for alt_count member in a bl_vcf_t structure.
Use this function to set alt_count in a bl_vcf_t variable
from non-member functions.  This function performs a direct
assignment for scalar or pointer structure members.  If
alt_count is a pointer, data previously pointed to should
generally be freed before calling this function to avoid memory
leaks.

Note that there is an equivalent macro (), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_alt_count is guaranteed by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.na

bl_vcf_t        bl_vcf;
unsigned        new_alt_count;

if ( bl_vcf_set_alt_count(&bl_vcf, new_alt_count) == BL_DATA_OK )
{
}
