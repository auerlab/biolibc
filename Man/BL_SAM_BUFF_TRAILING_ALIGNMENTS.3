.SH DESCRIPTION

Accessor macro for trailing_alignments.  Use this macro to reference trailing_alignments in
a bl_sam_buff_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_sam_buff_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_sam_buff_t   bl_sam_buff;
uint64_t        trailing_alignments;

trailing_alignments = BL_SAM_BUFF_TRAILING_ALIGNMENTS(&bl_sam_buff);
.ad
.fi
