.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for pos member in a bl_vcf_t structure.
Use this function to set pos in a bl_vcf_t variable
from non-member functions.  This function performs a direct
assignment for scalar or pointer structure members.  If
pos is a pointer, data previously pointed to should
generally be freed before calling this function to avoid memory
leaks.

Note that there is an equivalent macro (), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_pos is guaranteed by other means.

.na

bl_vcf_t        bl_vcf;
uint64_t        new_pos;

bl_vcf_set_pos(&bl_vcf, new_pos);
