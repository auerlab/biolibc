.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
feature         Pointer to a bl_gff3_t structure
gff3_stream      A FILE stream from which to read the line
field_mask      Bit mask indicating which fields to store in feature

.SH DESCRIPTION

Read next feature (line) from a GFF file.

feature must be initialized using BL_GFF3_INIT or bl_gff3_init()
before being passed to this function.

bl_gff3_read() will allocate memory for string fields as needed.
The object should be passed to bl_gff3_free() as soon as possible
after the data are no longer needed.

If passed an object that is not in an initialized state,
bl_gff3_read() will free and initialize it before repopulating it
with a new feature.

If field_mask is not BL_GFF3_FIELD_ALL, fields not indicated by a 1
in the bit mask are discarded rather than stored in feature.
That field in the structure is then populated with an appropriate
marker, such as '.'.  Possible mask values are:

BL_GFF3_FIELD_ALL
BL_GFF3_FIELD_SEQID
BL_GFF3_FIELD_SOURCE
BL_GFF3_FIELD_TYPE
BL_GFF3_FIELD_START
BL_GFF3_FIELD_END
BL_GFF3_FIELD_SCORE
BL_GFF3_FIELD_STRAND
BL_GFF3_FIELD_PHASE
BL_GFF3_FIELD_ATTRIBUTES

.SH RETURN VALUES

BL_READ_OK on successful read
BL_READ_EOF if EOF is encountered after a complete feature
BL_READ_TRUNCATED if EOF or bad data is encountered elsewhere
