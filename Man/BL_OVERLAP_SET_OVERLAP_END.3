BL_OVERLAP_SET_OVERLAP_END(ptr,overlap_end)

ptr              Pointer to a bl_overlap_t structure
overlap_end      New value for ptr->overlap_end

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for overlap_end.  Use this macro to set the overlap_end of
a bl_overlap_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_overlap_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_overlap_t   bl_overlap;

BL_OVERLAP_SET_OVERLAP_END(&bl_overlap, new_overlap_end);
.ad
.fi
