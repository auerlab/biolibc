.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for overlap_end.  Use this macro to set overlap_end in
a bl_overlap_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_overlap_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_overlap_set_overlap_end(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_overlap_end is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_overlap_t    bl_overlap;
uint64_t        new_overlap_end;

BL_OVERLAP_SET_OVERLAP_END(&bl_overlap, new_overlap_end);
