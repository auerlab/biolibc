.SH DESCRIPTION

Accessor macro for ref_count.  Use this macro to reference ref_count in
a bl_vcf_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_vcf_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_vcf_t        bl_vcf;
unsigned        ref_count;

ref_count = BL_VCF_REF_COUNT(&bl_vcf);
.ad
.fi

See biolibc/vcf.h for a full list of macros.
