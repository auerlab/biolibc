.SH DESCRIPTION

Initialize a SAM alignment buffer for holding recently read SAM
alignments.  This is useful, for example, when scanning a SAM
stream for alignments overlapping a certain region or position.
The buffer array is set to a
reasonable initial size and extended as far as SAM_BUFF_MAX_SIZE
by sam_buff_add_alignment(3) if needed.  A minimum MAPQ value
is stored in the sam_buff_t structure for filtering with
sam_buff_alignment_ok(3).
