.SH DESCRIPTION

The gff3_index_t class maintains an in-memory index of GFF
features, containing the GFF fields SEQ_ID, START, and END,
and the offset into the file as reported by ftell(3), or by
bl_gff3_read(3), which records the file position of each GFF
feature it reads.

.B bl_gff3_index_add_pos(3)
adds a GFF feature with file position file_pos to the index.
Features of interest, perhaps only genes or only exons, can
be added to the index on-the fly while reading through a GFF
file with bl_gff3_read(3).

The index can later be searched or traversed forward or backward
to quickly find
the location of a feature and reposition a FILE pointer to it
using fseek(3).  This system eliminates the need to inhale
large numbers of GFF features into memory.

.SH RETURN VALUES

BL_GFF3_INDEX_OK on success, BL_GFF3_MALLOC_FAILED if memory could
not be allocated
