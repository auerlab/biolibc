.SH SYNOPSIS

int     bl_bed_write(FILE *bed_stream, bl_bed_t *bed_feature,
bed_field_mask_t field_mask)
.ad
.fi

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
bed_stream:     FILE stream to which TSV bed line is written
bed_feature:    Pointer to the bl_bed_t structure to output
field_mask:     Bit mask indicating which fields to output
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Write fields from one line of a bed file to the specified FILE
stream.  If field_mask is not BL_BED_FIELD_ALL, only selected fields
are written.

If field_mask is not BL_BED_FIELD_ALL, fields not indicated by a 1
in the bit mask are written as an appropriate marker for that field,
such as a '.', rather than writing the real data.
Possible mask values are:

BL_BED_FIELD_NAME
BL_BED_FIELD_SCORE
BL_BED_FIELD_STRAND
BL_BED_FIELD_THICK
BL_BED_FIELD_RGB
BL_BED_FIELD_BLOCK

The chrom, start, and end fields are required and therefore have
no corresponding mask bits. The thickStart and thickEnd fields must
occur together or not at all, so only a single bit BL_BED_FIELD_THICK
selects both of them.  Likewise, blockCount, blockSizes and
blockStarts must all be present or omitted, so BL_BED_FIELD_BLOCK
masks all three.

bl_bed_write(stdout, &bed_feature, BL_BED_FIELD_ALL);
bl_bed_write(bed_stream, &bed_feature,
BL_BED_FIELD_NAME|BL_BED_FIELD_SCORE);
