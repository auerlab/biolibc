.SH SYNOPSIS

BL_OVERLAP_SET_FEATURE1_LEN(ptr,feature1_len)
.ad
.fi

.SH ARGUMENTS

ptr              Pointer to a bl_overlap_t structure
feature1_len     New value for ptr->feature1_len
.ad

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for feature1_len.  Use this macro to set the feature1_len of
a bl_overlap_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_overlap_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_overlap_t   bl_overlap;

BL_OVERLAP_SET_FEATURE1_LEN(&bl_overlap, new_feature1_len);
.ad
.fi
