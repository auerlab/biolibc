BL_VCF_SET_FORMAT(ptr, new_format)

.SH ARGUMENTS

ptr             Pointer to a bl_vcf_t structure
new_format      New value for format

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for format.  Use this macro to set format in
a bl_vcf_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_vcf_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_vcf_set_format(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_format is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_vcf_t        bl_vcf;
char *          new_format;

BL_VCF_SET_FORMAT(&bl_vcf, new_format);
.ad
.fi
