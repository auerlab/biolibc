.SH DESCRIPTION

Compare the positions of a GFF feature and a SAM alignment and
return a status value much like strcmp().  0 is returned if the
feature and alignment overlap.  A value < 0 is returned if the
feature is entirely "before" the alignment, i.e. it is on an
earlier chromosome according to bl_chrom_name_cmp(3), or on the
same chromosome at a lower position.  A value > 0 is returned
if the feature is entirely "after" the alignment, i.e. on a later
chromosome or same chromosome and higher position.

This function is mainly intended for programs that sweep properly
sorted GFF and SAM files locating overlaps in a single pass.

A converse function, bl_sam_gff3_cmp(3) is also provided so that
the programmer can choose the more intuitive interface.

.SH RETURN VALUES

A value < 0 if the the feature is entirely before the alignment
A value > 0 if the the feature is entirely after the alignment
0 if the feature and the alignment overlap
