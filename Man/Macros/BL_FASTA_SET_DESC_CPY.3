.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.nf 
.na
BL_FASTA_SET_DESC_CPY(ptr, new_desc)
.ad
.fi

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
ptr             Pointer to a bl_fasta_t structure
new_desc        New value for desc
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for desc.  Use this macro to set desc in
a bl_fasta_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_fasta_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_fasta_set_desc_cpy(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_desc is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_fasta_t      bl_fasta;
char *          new_desc[];

BL_FASTA_SET_DESC_CPY(&bl_fasta, new_desc);
.ad
.fi
