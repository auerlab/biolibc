.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.nf 
.na
BL_SAM_SET_RNAME(ptr,rname)
.ad
.fi

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
ptr              Pointer to a bl_sam_t structure
rname            New value for ptr->rname
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for rname.  Use this macro to set the rname of
a bl_sam_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_sam_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_sam_t   bl_sam;

BL_SAM_SET_RNAME(&bl_sam, new_rname);
.ad
.fi
