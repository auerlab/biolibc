.SH SYNOPSIS

BL_FASTQ_SET_PLUS_AE(ptr, c, new_plus_element)

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
ptr                     Pointer to a bl_fastq_t structure
c                       Subscript to plus array
new_plus_element        New value for plus[c]
.ad

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for plus array elements.  Use this macro to set
an element of plus in a bl_fastq_t structure from functions
that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_fastq_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_fastq_set_plus_ae(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_plus_element is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_fastq_t      bl_fastq;
size_t          c;
char *          new_plus_element;

BL_FASTQ_SET_PLUS_AE(&bl_fastq, c, new_plus_element);
