.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.nf 
.na
BL_SAM_CIGAR_AE(ptr, c)
.ad
.fi

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf

ptr             Pointer to a bl_sam_t structure
c               Subscript to the cigar array
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Accessor macro for cigar array elements.  Use this macro to reference
an element of cigar in a bl_sam_t structure from functions
that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_sam_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_sam_t        bl_sam;
size_t          c;
char            element;

element = BL_SAM_CIGAR_AE(&bl_sam,c);
.ad
.fi
