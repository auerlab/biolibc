.SH DESCRIPTION

Accessor macro for plus.  Use this macro to reference plus in
a bl_fastq_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_fastq_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_fastq_t      bl_fastq;
char *          plus;

plus = BL_FASTQ_PLUS(&bl_fastq);
.ad
.fi

See biolibc/fastq.h for a full list of macros.
