.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.nf 
.na
BL_GFF_SET_GENE_NAME_CPY(ptr, new_gene_name)
.ad
.fi

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
ptr             Pointer to a bl_gff_t structure
new_gene_name   New value for gene_name
.ad

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for gene_name.  Use this macro to set gene_name in
a bl_gff_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_gff_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_gff_set_gene_name_cpy(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_gene_name is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_gff_t        bl_gff;
char *          new_gene_name[];

BL_GFF_SET_GENE_NAME_CPY(&bl_gff, new_gene_name);
