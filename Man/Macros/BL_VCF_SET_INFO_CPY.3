.SH SYNOPSIS

BL_VCF_SET_INFO_CPY(ptr, new_info)

.SH ARGUMENTS

ptr             Pointer to a bl_vcf_t structure
new_info        New value for info
.ad

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for info.  Use this macro to set info in
a bl_vcf_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_vcf_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_vcf_set_info_cpy(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_info is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_vcf_t        bl_vcf;
char *          new_info[];

BL_VCF_SET_INFO_CPY(&bl_vcf, new_info);
.ad
