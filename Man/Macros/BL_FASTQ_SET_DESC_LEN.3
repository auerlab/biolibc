.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.nf 
.na
BL_FASTQ_SET_DESC_LEN(ptr, new_desc_len)
.ad
.fi

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
ptr             Pointer to a bl_fastq_t structure
new_desc_len    New value for desc_len
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for desc_len.  Use this macro to set desc_len in
a bl_fastq_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_fastq_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_fastq_set_desc_len(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_desc_len is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_fastq_t      bl_fastq;
size_t          new_desc_len;

BL_FASTQ_SET_DESC_LEN(&bl_fastq, new_desc_len);
.ad
.fi
