.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.nf 
.na
BL_SAM_SET_MAPQ(ptr, new_mapq)
.ad
.fi

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
ptr             Pointer to a bl_sam_t structure
new_mapq        New value for mapq
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for mapq.  Use this macro to set mapq in
a bl_sam_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_sam_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_sam_set_mapq(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_mapq is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_sam_t        bl_sam;
unsigned char   new_mapq;

BL_SAM_SET_MAPQ(&bl_sam, new_mapq);
.ad
.fi
