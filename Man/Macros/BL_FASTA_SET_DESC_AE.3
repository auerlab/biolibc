.SH SYNOPSIS

.na
BL_FASTA_SET_DESC_AE(ptr, c, new_desc_element)
.ad
.fi

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
ptr                     Pointer to a bl_fasta_t structure
c                       Subscript to desc array
new_desc_element        New value for desc[c]
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for desc array elements.  Use this macro to set
an element of desc in a bl_fasta_t structure from functions
that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_fasta_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_fasta_set_desc_ae(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_desc_element is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_fasta_t      bl_fasta;
size_t          c;
char *          new_desc_element;

BL_FASTA_SET_DESC_AE(&bl_fasta, c, new_desc_element);
