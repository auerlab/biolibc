BL_GFF_SET_START(ptr, new_start)

ptr             Pointer to a bl_gff_t structure
new_start       New value for start

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for start.  Use this macro to set start in
a bl_gff_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_gff_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_gff_set_start(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_start is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_gff_t        bl_gff;
uint64_t        new_start;

BL_GFF_SET_START(&bl_gff, new_start);
.ad
.fi
