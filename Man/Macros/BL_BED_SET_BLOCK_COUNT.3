.SH SYNOPSIS

.nf 
.na
BL_BED_SET_BLOCK_COUNT(ptr, new_block_count)
.ad

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
ptr             Pointer to a bl_bed_t structure
new_block_count New value for block_count
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for block_count.  Use this macro to set block_count in
a bl_bed_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_bed_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_bed_set_block_count(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_block_count is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_bed_t        bl_bed;
unsigned short  new_block_count;

BL_BED_SET_BLOCK_COUNT(&bl_bed, new_block_count);
.ad
.fi
