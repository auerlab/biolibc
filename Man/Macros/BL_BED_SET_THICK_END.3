.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.nf 
.na
BL_BED_SET_THICK_END(ptr, new_thick_end)
.ad

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
ptr             Pointer to a bl_bed_t structure
new_thick_end   New value for thick_end
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for thick_end.  Use this macro to set thick_end in
a bl_bed_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_bed_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_bed_set_thick_end(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_thick_end is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_bed_t        bl_bed;
uint64_t        new_thick_end;

BL_BED_SET_THICK_END(&bl_bed, new_thick_end);
.ad
