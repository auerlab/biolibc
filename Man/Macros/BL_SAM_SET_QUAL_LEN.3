.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.nf 
.na
BL_SAM_SET_QUAL_LEN(ptr, new_qual_len)
.ad
.fi

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
ptr             Pointer to a bl_sam_t structure
new_qual_len    New value for qual_len
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for qual_len.  Use this macro to set qual_len in
a bl_sam_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_sam_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_sam_set_qual_len(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_qual_len is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_sam_t        bl_sam;
size_t          new_qual_len;

BL_SAM_SET_QUAL_LEN(&bl_sam, new_qual_len);
.ad
