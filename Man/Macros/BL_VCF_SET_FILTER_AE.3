BL_VCF_SET_FILTER_AE(ptr, c, new_filter_element)

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
ptr                     Pointer to a bl_vcf_t structure
c                       Subscript to filter array
new_filter_element      New value for filter[c]

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for filter array elements.  Use this macro to set
an element of filter in a bl_vcf_t structure from functions
that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_vcf_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_vcf_set_filter_ae(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_filter_element is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_vcf_t        bl_vcf;
size_t          c;
char            new_filter_element;

BL_VCF_SET_FILTER_AE(&bl_vcf, c, new_filter_element);
