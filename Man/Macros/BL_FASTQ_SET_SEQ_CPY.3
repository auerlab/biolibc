BL_FASTQ_SET_SEQ_CPY(ptr, new_seq)

.SH ARGUMENTS

ptr             Pointer to a bl_fastq_t structure
new_seq         New value for seq

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for seq.  Use this macro to set seq in
a bl_fastq_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_fastq_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_fastq_set_seq_cpy(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_seq is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_fastq_t      bl_fastq;
char *          new_seq[];

BL_FASTQ_SET_SEQ_CPY(&bl_fastq, new_seq);
