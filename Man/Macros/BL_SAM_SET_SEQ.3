new_seq         New value for seq

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for seq.  Use this macro to set seq in
a bl_sam_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_sam_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_sam_set_seq(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_seq is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_sam_t        bl_sam;
char *          new_seq;

BL_SAM_SET_SEQ(&bl_sam, new_seq);
.ad
.fi
