.SH ARGUMENTS

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for max_discarded_score.  Use this macro to set max_discarded_score in
a bl_sam_buff_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_sam_buff_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_sam_buff_set_max_discarded_score(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_max_discarded_score is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_sam_buff_t   bl_sam_buff;
uint64_t        new_max_discarded_score;

BL_SAM_BUFF_SET_MAX_DISCARDED_SCORE(&bl_sam_buff, new_max_discarded_score);
