.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.nf 
.na
BL_VCF_FORMAT_AE(ptr, c)
.ad
.fi

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf

ptr             Pointer to a bl_vcf_t structure
c               Subscript to the format array
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Accessor macro for format array elements.  Use this macro to reference
an element of format in a bl_vcf_t structure from functions
that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_vcf_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_vcf_t        bl_vcf;
size_t          c;
char *          element;

element = BL_VCF_FORMAT_AE(&bl_vcf,c);
.ad
.fi
