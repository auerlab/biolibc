BL_GFF_SET_SEQUENCE_CPY(ptr, new_sequence)

ptr             Pointer to a bl_gff_t structure
new_sequence    New value for sequence

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for sequence.  Use this macro to set sequence in
a bl_gff_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_gff_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_gff_set_sequence_cpy(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_sequence is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_gff_t        bl_gff;
char            new_sequence[];

BL_GFF_SET_SEQUENCE_CPY(&bl_gff, new_sequence);
