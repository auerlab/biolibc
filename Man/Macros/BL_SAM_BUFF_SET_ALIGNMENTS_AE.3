.SH SYNOPSIS

BL_SAM_BUFF_SET_ALIGNMENTS_AE(ptr, c, new_alignments_element)
.ad

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
ptr                     Pointer to a bl_sam_buff_t structure
c                       Subscript to alignments array
new_alignments_element  New value for alignments[c]
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for alignments array elements.  Use this macro to set
an element of alignments in a bl_sam_buff_t structure from functions
that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_sam_buff_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_sam_buff_set_alignments_ae(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_alignments_element is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_sam_buff_t   bl_sam_buff;
size_t          c;
bl_sam_t **     new_alignments_element;

BL_SAM_BUFF_SET_ALIGNMENTS_AE(&bl_sam_buff, c, new_alignments_element);
