.SH SYNOPSIS

.na
BL_SAM_BUFF_SET_ALIGNMENTS_CPY(ptr, new_alignments)
.ad

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
ptr             Pointer to a bl_sam_buff_t structure
new_alignments  New value for alignments
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for alignments.  Use this macro to set alignments in
a bl_sam_buff_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_sam_buff_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_sam_buff_set_alignments_cpy(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_alignments is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_sam_buff_t   bl_sam_buff;
bl_sam_t **     new_alignments[];

BL_SAM_BUFF_SET_ALIGNMENTS_CPY(&bl_sam_buff, new_alignments);
