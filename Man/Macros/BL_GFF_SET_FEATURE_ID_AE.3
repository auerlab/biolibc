.SH SYNOPSIS

BL_GFF_SET_FEATURE_ID_AE(ptr, c, new_feature_id_element)
.ad

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
ptr                     Pointer to a bl_gff_t structure
c                       Subscript to feature_id array
new_feature_id_element  New value for feature_id[c]
.ad

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for feature_id array elements.  Use this macro to set
an element of feature_id in a bl_gff_t structure from functions
that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_gff_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_gff_set_feature_id_ae(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_feature_id_element is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_gff_t        bl_gff;
size_t          c;
char *          new_feature_id_element;

BL_GFF_SET_FEATURE_ID_AE(&bl_gff, c, new_feature_id_element);
