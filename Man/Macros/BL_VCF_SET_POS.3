BL_VCF_SET_POS(ptr, new_pos)

ptr             Pointer to a bl_vcf_t structure
new_pos         New value for pos

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for pos.  Use this macro to set pos in
a bl_vcf_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_vcf_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_vcf_set_pos(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_pos is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_vcf_t        bl_vcf;
uint64_t        new_pos;

BL_VCF_SET_POS(&bl_vcf, new_pos);
.ad
.fi
