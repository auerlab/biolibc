.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.nf 
.na
BL_SAM_BUFF_SET_READS_USED(ptr, new_reads_used)
.ad
.fi

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
ptr             Pointer to a bl_sam_buff_t structure
new_reads_used  New value for reads_used
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for reads_used.  Use this macro to set reads_used in
a bl_sam_buff_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_sam_buff_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_sam_buff_set_reads_used(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_reads_used is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_sam_buff_t   bl_sam_buff;
uint64_t        new_reads_used;

BL_SAM_BUFF_SET_READS_USED(&bl_sam_buff, new_reads_used);
