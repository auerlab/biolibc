.SH SYNOPSIS

BL_SAM_BUFF_SET_ALIGNMENTS(ptr,c,new_alignment)

.fi

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
ptr              Pointer to a bl_sam_buff_t structure
c                Subscript to alignments array
new_alignment    New value for ptr->alignments
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for alignments.  Use this macro to set the alignments of
a bl_sam_buff_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_sam_buff_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_sam_buff_t   bl_sam_buff;
size_t          c;

BL_SAM_BUFF_SET_ALIGNMENTS(&bl_sam_buff, c, new_alignment);
.ad
.fi
