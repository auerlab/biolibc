.SH SYNOPSIS

.nf 
.na
BL_GFF_FEATURE_NAME_AE(ptr, c)
.ad
.fi

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
ptr             Pointer to a bl_gff_t structure
c               Subscript to the feature_name array
.ad

.SH DESCRIPTION

Accessor macro for feature_name array elements.  Use this macro to reference
an element of feature_name in a bl_gff_t structure from functions
that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_gff_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_gff_t        bl_gff;
size_t          c;
char *          element;

element = BL_GFF_FEATURE_NAME_AE(&bl_gff,c);
.ad
.fi
