.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
int     bl_overlap_set_all(bl_overlap_t *overlap,
uint64_t feature1_len, uint64_t feature2_len,
uint64_t overlap_start, uint64_t overlap_end)

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
feature1_len      Length of feature 1
feature2_len      Length of feature 2
overlap_start    Start position of overlap relative to start of feature 1
overlap_end      End position of overlap relative to start of feature 1
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Set all fields in a bl_overlap_t structure.  Start and end
positions are 1-based regardless of the feature type.  (BED file
positions are 0-based and must be adjusted before passed to this
function.)

.SH RETURN VALUES

BL_DATA_OK upon success.
BL_DATA_INVALID is arguments don't make sense.

.na

    bed_start = BL_BED_CHROM_START(bed_feature);
    bed_end = BL_BED_CHROM_END(bed_feature);
    gff_start = BL_GFF_CHROM_START(gff_feature);
    gff_end = BL_GFF_CHROM_END(gff_feature);
    bed_len = bed_end - bed_start;
    gff_len = gff_end - gff_start + 1;
    bl_overlap_set_all(overlap, bed_len, gff_len,
                    MAX(bed_start+1, gff_start),
                    MIN(bed_end, gff_end));
