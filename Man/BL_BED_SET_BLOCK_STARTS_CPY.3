.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.nf 
.na
BL_BED_SET_BLOCK_STARTS_CPY(ptr, new_block_starts)
.ad

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
ptr             Pointer to a bl_bed_t structure
new_block_starts New value for block_starts
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for block_starts.  Use this macro to set block_starts in
a bl_bed_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_bed_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function bl_bed_set_block_starts_cpy(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_block_starts is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_bed_t        bl_bed;
uint64_t *      new_block_starts[];

BL_BED_SET_BLOCK_STARTS_CPY(&bl_bed, new_block_starts);
