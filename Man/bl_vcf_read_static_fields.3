.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
int     bl_vcf_read_static_fields(FILE *vcf_stream, bl_vcf_t *vcf_call,
vcf_field_mask_t field_mask)

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
vcf_stream  FILE stream for VCF input
vcf_call    Pointer to bl_vcf_t structure to receive fields
field_mask  Bit mask indicating which fields should be stored
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Read static fields (columns 1 to 9) from one line of a VCF file.
This function does not read any of the sample data in columns 10
and on.  Samples can be read using a loop with tsv_read_field(3).

If field_mask is not BL_VCF_FIELD_ALL, fields not indicated by a 1
in the bit mask are discarded rather than stored in bed_feature.
Possible mask values are:

BL_VCF_FIELD_ALL
BL_VCF_FIELD_CHROM
BL_VCF_FIELD_POS
BL_VCF_FIELD_ID
BL_VCF_FIELD_REF
BL_VCF_FIELD_ALT
BL_VCF_FIELD_QUAL
BL_VCF_FIELD_FILTER
BL_VCF_FIELD_INFO
BL_VCF_FIELD_FORMAT

.SH RETURN VALUES

BL_READ_OK upon success
BL_READ_TRUNCATED if EOF is encountered while reading a call
BL_READ_EOF if EOF is encountered between calls as it should be
