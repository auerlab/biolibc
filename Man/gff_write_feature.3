.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
gff_stream:     FILE stream to which TSV gff line is written
gff_feature:    Pointer to the bl_gff_t structure to output
field_mask:     Bit mask indicating which fields to output

.SH DESCRIPTION

Write fields from a GFF feature to the specified FILE
stream.

If field_mask is not BL_GFF_FIELD_ALL, fields not indicated by a 1
in the bit mask are written as an appropriate marker for that field,
such as a '.', rather than writing the real data.
Possible mask values are:

BL_GFF_FIELD_ALL
BL_GFF_FIELD_SEQUENCE
BL_GFF_FIELD_SOURCE
BL_GFF_FIELD_NAME
BL_GFF_FIELD_START_POS
BL_GFF_FIELD_END_POS
BL_GFF_FIELD_SCORE
BL_GFF_FIELD_STRAND
BL_GFF_FIELD_PHASE
BL_GFF_FIELD_ATTRIBUTES
