BL_BED_BLOCK_COUNT(ptr)

.SH DESCRIPTION

Accessor macro for block_count.  Use this macro to reference block_count in
a bl_bed_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_bed_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_bed_t        bl_bed;
unsigned short  block_count;

block_count = BL_BED_BLOCK_COUNT(&bl_bed);
.ad
.fi
