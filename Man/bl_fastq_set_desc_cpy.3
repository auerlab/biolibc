.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.nf 
.na
int     bl_fastq_set_desc_cpy(bl_fastq_t *bl_fastq_ptr, char * new_desc, size_t array_size)
.ad
.fi

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
bl_fastq_ptr    Pointer to the bl_bed_t structure to set
new_desc        The new value for desc
array_size      Size of the desc array.
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for desc member in a bl_fastq_t structure.
Use this function to set desc in a bl_fastq_t variable
from non-member functions.  This function copies the array pointed to
by new_desc to ->desc.

Note that there is an equivalent macro BL_FASTQ_SET_DESC(), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_desc is guaranteed by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.na

bl_fastq_t      bl_fastq;
char *          new_desc;
size_t          array_size;

if ( bl_fastq_set_desc(&bl_fastq, new_desc, array_size) == BL_DATA_OK )
{
}
