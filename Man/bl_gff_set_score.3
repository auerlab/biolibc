.SH SYNOPSIS

int     bl_gff_set_score(bl_gff_t *bl_gff_ptr, double new_score)

.SH ARGUMENTS

bl_gff_ptr      Pointer to the structure to set
new_score       The new value for score
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for score member in a bl_gff_t structure.
Use this function to set score in a bl_gff_t variable
from non-member functions.  This function performs a direct
assignment for scalar or pointer structure members.  If
score is a pointer, data previously pointed to should
generally be freed before calling this function to avoid memory
leaks.

Note that there is an equivalent macro (), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_score is guaranteed by other means.

.SH RETURN VALUES

BL_GFF_DATA_OK if the new value is acceptable and assigned
BL_GFF_DATA_OUT_OF_RANGE otherwise
