.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for total_alignments member in a bl_sam_buff_t structure.
Use this function to set total_alignments in a bl_sam_buff_t variable
from non-member functions.  This function performs a direct
assignment for scalar or pointer structure members.  If
total_alignments is a pointer, data previously pointed to should
generally be freed before calling this function to avoid memory
leaks.

Note that there is an equivalent macro (), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_total_alignments is guaranteed by other means.

bl_sam_buff_t   bl_sam_buff;

if ( bl_sam_buff_set_total_alignments(&bl_sam_buff, new_total_alignments) == BL_DATA_OK )
