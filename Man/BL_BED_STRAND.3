.SH DESCRIPTION

Accessor macro for strand.  Use this macro to reference strand in
a bl_bed_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the bl_bed_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
bl_bed_t        bl_bed;
char            strand;

strand = BL_BED_STRAND(&bl_bed);
.ad
.fi
