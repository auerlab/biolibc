.SH SYNOPSIS

int     sam_read_alignment(FILE *sam_stream, bl_sam_t *sam_alignment,
sam_field_mask_t field_mask)
.ad
.fi

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
sam_stream:     A FILE stream from which to read the line
sam_alignment:  Pointer to a bl_sam_t structure
field_mask:     Bit mask indicating which fields to store in sam_alignment
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Read next alignment (line) from a SAM stream.

If field_mask is not BL_SAM_FIELD_ALL, fields not indicated by a 1
in the bit mask are discarded rather than stored in sam_alignment.
That field in the structure is then populated with an appropriate
marker, such as '.'.  Possible mask values are:

BL_SAM_FIELD_ALL
BL_SAM_FIELD_QNAME
BL_SAM_FIELD_FLAG
BL_SAM_FIELD_RNAME
BL_SAM_FIELD_POS
BL_SAM_FIELD_MAPQ
BL_SAM_FIELD_CIGAR
BL_SAM_FIELD_RNEXT
BL_SAM_FIELD_PNEXT
BL_SAM_FIELD_TLEN
BL_SAM_FIELD_SEQ
BL_SAM_FIELD_QUAL
