.SH DESCRIPTION

Skip over meta-data lines in VCF input stream, leaving the FILE
structure pointing to the first character in the first line of data
or the first character of the header line starting with #CHROM if
one is present.  The header line is typically read using
bl_vcf_get_sample_ids(3). The skipped meta-data is copied to a
temporary file whose FILE pointer is returned.

.SH RETURN VALUES

BL_READ_OK upon success, BL_READ_TRUNCATED if read fails
