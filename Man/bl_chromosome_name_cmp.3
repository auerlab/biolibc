.SH DESCRIPTION

Perform a numeric comparison of two chromosome names.

The names may contain a prefix of non-digits, such as "chr".
Characters that follow must be a chromosome number or letter.
Numbers are considered less than letters (e.g. 22 < X).  As such,
if either is a letter, they are compared lexically.  If both are
numbers, they are converted to integers and compared numerically.

Use bl_chromosome_name_cmp() only if you need to know which string is
< or >.  If only checking for equality/inequality, strcmp() will be
faster.
